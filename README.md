# Food_Inspection_Dashboard-Tableau-

The purpose of this dashboard is to help inspectors visually explore their inspections in order to obtain a better understanding of the current situation and make informed decisions with the objective of process optimization and better hygiene of food establishments. 

<br><br>The specific business cases of our dashboard focus on the frequency of inspections taking place throughout the state of Massachusetts for all the locations available in the data. Based on the inspections count, the dashboard allows users to dive deeper to see the relationships between the inspections with other variables such as license number, business name, legal owner, location, violation type and violation level. Discovering the pattern in the data could potentially help inspectors optimize their inspection process and eventually improve the city service by maintaining acceptable food hygiene, and preventing food related illness. 
<br><br>
The dashboard offers the capability to navigate the data in a multidimensional perspective. It helps with providing details on which areas accounted to the maximum inspections, giving the trends observed in a particular area depending on time, presenting the details about the businesses involved in the inspection as well as showing the detailed comments on the inspections.
